# Linked List Implementation in Python

A clean and minimal implementation of a **singly linked list** in Python, built from scratch without using Python’s built-in list.  
This project focuses on mastering **core data structure fundamentals** and pointer-based logic.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered

- Singly Linked List
- Node-based data structures
- Dynamic memory behavior
- Traversal using references
- Safe deletion logic
- Length tracking

---

## 🏗️ Structure

### Node
Each node:
- Stores a data element
- Holds a reference to the next node

### LinkedList
Manages the list and provides core operations:
- `add(element)` – Adds an element to the end of the list
- `remove(element)` – Removes the first occurrence of an element
- `is_empty()` – Checks whether the list is empty
